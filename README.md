# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
My token contract address
0xfC6406Ef530549415e89180532c88139979c2a66

Staking contract address
0x59D0D7eea25814a1291108af01F71B54eC554ac8

This is the both contract address.
